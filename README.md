# UniWeekJam
Game created in a week as a team where you beat each other to the beat, designed to be local player vs player.

My main contributions:
Damage system
Stamina functionality
Beat system (Looked into FFT but went with simple bpm)
Scoreboard
Lighting following player and beat
Able to end and restart the game
